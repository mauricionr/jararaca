Using virtualenv is recommended.

Run `pip install -r requirement` to install all dependencies.

Run ./jararaca to see options.

Run `nosetests --rednose` to run tests. It works when run at the root directory.

Running `nosetests --rednose --with-watch` will run tests whenever a `.py` file is saved.
